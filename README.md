## If you've decided to join:
1. Read [Join the #100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4)
2. Fork this repo and commit to the [Log](log.md) daily. [Example](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-kallaway-log).
3. **Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**
4. Change the date in [Rules](rules.md) to the day you've started the challenge.
5. Delete the examples in the log, or comment them out, and start filling it with your own content.
6. **Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.**
7. Follow [100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) Twitter Bot that retweets all the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. It's a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community. Thanks [@amanhimself](https://twitter.com/amanhimself) for creating it!
8. Important: Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
9. If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or just tweet at me (see info below)
